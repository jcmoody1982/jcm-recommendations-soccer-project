## Use Cases

### UC-001: Upcoming Fixtures for Supported Leagues

**Goal:** Display a list of upcoming fixtures for all supported leagues, refreshed daily.

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the next upcoming fixtures for leagues I care about so that I can plan what matches to watch.

**Data Required:**
- **League**: name, country, image
- **Season**: id, year, country (use only the **latest/current season** per league)
- **Fixture**: id, league/season, home team, away team, match date/time, venue, status
- **Team**: id, name

**API Source:** football-data-api.com

**Leagues:** 42 leagues returned from `/league-list?chosen_leagues_only=true`. Use only the **last season entry** from each league's `season` array (the current season). Example leagues:
- England: Premier League, Championship, EFL League One, EFL League Two
- Spain: La Liga, Segunda División
- Germany: Bundesliga, 2. Bundesliga
- Italy: Serie A, Serie B
- France: Ligue 1, Ligue 2
- Portugal: Liga NOS, LigaPro
- Netherlands: Eredivisie
- Belgium: Pro League
- Scotland: Premiership, League One
- Turkey: Süper Lig
- Brazil: Serie A, Serie B
- USA: MLS
- Mexico: Liga MX
- And more (42 total)

**Behavior:**
- Fetch league list from API (or use cached version)
- For each league, extract the **last entry** from the `season` array (= current season ID)
- Pull upcoming fixtures for the next **7 days** using the current season ID
- Refresh data on a **daily schedule**
- Store fixtures locally so the app can serve them without hitting the API on every request

**Status:** Reviewed

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Define domain entities (League, Fixture, Team)
- [ ] Implement persistence layer
- [ ] Build API client to fetch data
- [ ] Implement daily refresh scheduler

### UC-002: Maintain Distinct Team List from Fixtures

**Goal:** Build and maintain a distinct list of team domain objects extracted from fixture data.

**User Story:** As the system, I want to maintain a canonical list of teams so that team data is normalized and reusable across features.

**Data Required:**
- **Team**: id, name (extracted from fixture `homeID`/`awayID` and `home_name`/`away_name`)

**API Source:** Derived from `/league-matches` responses (no separate API call needed)

**Behavior:**
- When fixtures are fetched (UC-001), extract team data from each match
- For each fixture, capture both home and away team (id + name)
- Deduplicate by team ID to maintain a distinct list
- Update team records if name changes (upsert logic)
- Teams are linked to fixtures via foreign key relationship

**Dependencies:** UC-001 (fixtures must be fetched first)

**Status:** Draft

**Open Questions:**
- Should we store which league(s) a team belongs to?
- Do we need additional team data beyond id/name (e.g., logo, country)?
